# Steps for running the code

1. To run this code a user will require Python 3 and the below listed packages to be installed.  It is recommended that a user downloads Anaconda as these particular packages are already pre-installed.  You can find a link to Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  Alternatively Python 3 can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 


2. Should the user decide not to use Anaconda. He/ she can install the below the packages by calling the below on their command line:  

- pip install pandas
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install numpy 


3. Installing cmder is recommended for users on Windows machines. cmder can be downloaded [here](https://cmder.net/). The command line on Linux and Mac is is suitable however.   The code is public and therefore can be pulled from GitHub by anyone. 


4. A user can interact with the code by running "_jupyter lab_" from the local directory the this repository is pulled to. Jupyter will launch in their default browser. 


5. Sometimes Github does not render Jupyter Notebooks correctly.  If this occurs you can view a static version of the Notebook on nbviewer by clicking this icon  [![nbviewer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2791223/29387450-e5654c72-8294-11e7-95e4-090419520edb.png)](https://nbviewer.org/github/RYANCOX00/Prog_DA/blob/main/Numpy_Random.ipynb). 

**None of the above steps are required to view the static code on nbviewer.**
